                    This is a website about surfing! Surfing was first invented in 347 B.C. when it was adopted by the chinese as a form of transportation. The U.S. quickly picked it up as competitive sport and it eventually made national headlines in 300 B.C.
                    It quickly became the most popular competitive sport, right behind ping-pong of course. It made it's way into the X-games just 200 years later. By this time, surfing became more advanced. Most surfboards at this time we're made of ABS plastic and we're very hard to break on smaller waves.
                    In fact, surfing became so popular that it resulted in the great economic boom of the year 100 A.D.
